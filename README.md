# Generating-Entangled-Steady-States-in-Multistable-Open-Quantum-Systems-via-Initial-State-Control
This repository contains the data to generate all data plots in the paper titled: Generating Entangled Steady States in Multistable Open Quantum Systems via Initial State Control. Additionally, we include sample codes to evaluate numerically the different expressions presented in the paper.
