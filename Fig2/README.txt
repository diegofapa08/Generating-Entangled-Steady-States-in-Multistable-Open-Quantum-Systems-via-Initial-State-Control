The MATLAB file creates panels b) and d) of Fig. (2).
For panel (b), the Balanced.txt file can be used with the first column being the overlap (x-axis), the second column being the concurrence obtained with Eq. (2), and the third column being the concurrence obtained in Eq. (5).
For panel (c), the Unbalanced.txt file can be used with the first column being the overlap (x-axis), the second column being the concurrence obtained with Eq. (3), and the third column being the concurrence obtained in Eq. (5).
